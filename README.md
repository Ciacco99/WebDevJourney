# WebDevJourney

28/06/22 - Jacopo Ferro

Web Development learning journey for the next weeks.

---

### Starting point
Extremely basic concepts of HTML, CSS, JS with no frameworks nor project experience.

### Goals
Learn basics and more advance concepts of web application development.

Learn useful frameworks, good practices, workflows. Keep track of progress and versions.

Build an application for personal fun and learning.

---

### Tentative Curriculum
This is my broad idea of what I think is a progressive curriculum for what i want to learn. It might change because as of now I don't have a good idea of what exactly is even required.
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Front-End frameworks
- Full-Stack Application with Back-End

The idea is to first learn the syntax, the basic concepts, then consolidate it by applying it to small-medium projects
along the way. Eventually introducing Back-End and frameworks that are actually used for development in industry.

## Workload
Expected Workload in actual focused deliberate practice hours:

#### Set-up, docs, progress tracking
- Ignored for simplicity, like this *README* or finding resources

#### Basics and Front-End
- **HTML:** 3h
- **CSS:** 2h
- **JS:** 4.5h
- **Front-End Projects and Practice:** 15h
- **React:** 20h

#### Specialization:
- **Course 1:** 30h
- **Course 2:** 30h
- **Course 3:** 45h

#### Personal Projects and Practice:
- I will try to carve out time for personal portfolio projects while following the curriculum but this is the one final point that can expand indefinitely once I know how to build.

**Total net expected time: *150.5h***
## Day to Day

I track my net working ours with timers and remove any break or pause, hence
5-6h of focused work might mean much more dedicated time to the tasks.

A realistic estimate including days off and holidays during this summer is 20-25 working days in July and same in August.

During these two months I have other tasks and projects to do so I suppose it will be a challenge to keep the pace of
5.5h/day (4h webdev + 1.5h other coding) for 40 days or 4.5h/day for 50 days.

I don't know if I will update this *README* often or for simplicity I will just privately keep track of my progress.

Just Kidding here's a tentative table I will update with various logs:

## WorkLog

| Log      | Topic | Net Hours | Notes                               |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 28/06/22 | Setup | 5h        | git, atom, resources, *README*      |
| 28/06/22 | HTML  | 2h40'     | followed video HTML                 |
| 29/06/22 | CSS   | 2h        | video CSS, then interactive version |
| 29/06/22 | Other | 1h        | articles and peak at new resources  |
| 30/06/22 | Other | 1h30'     |                                     |
| 30/06/22 |       |           |                                     |
|          |       |           |                                     |
|          |       |           |                                     |
|          |       |           |                                     |


*Other* refers to exploration regarding curriculum, further articles, project ideas and in general lateral activities and learning that are parallel to the main focus but would be harder to keep track precisely.  
Examples: learning markdown and environment to build it for the *README*, reading articles about tech stacks, discovering new resources.
