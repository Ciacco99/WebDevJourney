Web Development learning journey for the next weeks.

Starting point: extremely basic concepts of HTML, CSS, JS with no frameworks or actual valid experience.

Goal: learn basics and more advance concepts of web development, build projects and applications. Cross-platform and useful frameworks to have more hands-on experience.

Tentative Curriculum: HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript -> Full Stack Application

Expected Workload in actual deliberate practice hours:

HTML: 3h
CSS: 2h
JS: 4.5h
JS Projects: 15h
React: 20h

Specialization: 
Course 1: 30h
Course 2: 30h
Course 3: 45h

Total: 44.5h + 105h = 150.5h

Time: with 4h/day -> 38 days

July: 20d
Aug: 20d

LeetCode 2/day -> 1h30 avg/day -> total workload -> 5.5h/day.

Counting 5days/week, 5.5h of effective work each study day. All July and August.

Counting Everyday minus some days off: 50 days, 3h(WebDev) + 1.5h(Code) = 4.5h/day. All July and August.
