## Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Deployment 
Probably need to add some more plugins so that we can minify the final pack.
This is meant to be a lighter version to quickly develop without having the boilerplate
of Create-React-App.
